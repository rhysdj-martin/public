The West Midlands Police Cadet program has honed my abilities in leadership, teamwork, and community engagement, directly impacting local initiatives and safety. My role encompasses fostering community-police relationships, a cornerstone of my values and goals. At the West Midlands Police Museum, I facilitated visitor interactions, further sharpening my public relations acumen.

Educationally, I am immersed in the study of Uniformed Public Services at Birmingham Metropolitan College, augmenting my practical experiences with theoretical insights. This academic pursuit complements my dedication to public service, as reflected in my community development efforts and recognition, such as the DofE Bronze Award.
